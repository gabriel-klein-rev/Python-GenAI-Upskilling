## What Is PyPI?

PyPI stands for "Python Package Index". It is a Python-specific repository of software that allows developers to locate and install software for use in their own applications. Developers can also distribute their own software so that other Python programmers can integrate it into their projects.

Some examples of Python packages we might mention in these modules include:

- [flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
- [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)

## What Is pip?

The term `pip` is an acronym which can stand for various things depending on which a sources a developer consults. Some programmers might say that `pip` stands for "Pip Installs Packages" while others might say that it stands for "preferred installer program".

Regardless of what the acronym stands for, `pip` is simply a package installer for Python. Developers can use this tool to install packages from PyPI and other repositories.

### Using `pip` To Install and Manage Packages

As of version 3.4 of Python, `pip` is the preferred installer program for the language. As such, when a programmers installs Python, `pip` is included by default.

Developers can easily use `pip` as a command line tool. Common `pip` commands include:

- `pip search`: Used to search PyPI for packages
- `pip install`: Used to install packages from PyPI
- `pip uninstall`: Used to remove packages which have been installed
- `pip list`: Used to return a list of the packages which are installed in the current development environment
