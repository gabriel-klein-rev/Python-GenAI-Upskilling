# Description for the LLMs (GPT, BERT, Claude, Llama, Copilot, Codeium) topic

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of AI model that is trained on massive amounts of data. LLMs are also characterized by their ability to understand and generate natural language (NLP - Natural Language Processing).

## Common Use Cases of LLMs
- Summarizing Texts - Taking a lot of text and extracting the most important information from it
- ChatBots - Generating responses based on the context of the conversation
- Generative AI, creating new content - Generating new content based on the context of the content that is being generated, including text, images, videos, audio, and more
- Data Processing - taking data, performing statistical analysis, generating insights, filtering out noise, and more
- Grammar/Spelling checking - checking for grammar and spelling errors in text

## Different LLM Offerings:

### GPT
A popular example of an LLM is Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), developed by OpenAI. It is what ChatGPT, a popular chatbot, is built off. 

### BERT
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, or BERT, is an LLM that was developed by Google AI in 2018. BERT was praised for being very proficient in NLP. Thanks to the bidirectional nature by which BERT processes language - using text from both the left and right side - it is able to gain a deeper understanding of the context, and therefore the meanings of each word.

### Claude
Claude is an LLM which is offered by the company Anthropic. Claude is similar to ChatGPT in that it also offers a chat interface.

### LLaMa
LLaMa is Meta's offering of an LLM. It is a large language model that is trained on 1.7 trillion tokens. LLaMa is able to generate text, answer questions, and summarize text.

### Copilot
Copilot is an LLM that was developed by GitHub and OpenAI. It is able to generate code based on the context of the code that is being written. Copilot is able to generate code in a variety of languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go.

### Codeium
Codeium is an LLM that was developed by Codeium AI. It is similar to GitHub in that it is able to generate code based on the context of the code that is being written.

## Real World Application for the LLMs (GPT, BERT, Claude, Llama, Copilot, Codeium) Topic

### GPT
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) is built off of the GPT LLM. ChatGPT is a chatbot that is able to generate responses based on the context of the conversation. ChatGPT is able to generate responses that are very similar to how a human would respond. 


### Copilot
Github Copilot is a useful tool in software development. To try it out, visit their [site](https://github.com/features/copilot) and follow the instructions for starting a free trial (30 days). 

Once you have Copilot installed, you can use it in your IDE. Copilot will generate code based on the context of the code that you are writing.

For example, open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), install the Github Copilot Extension, and ensure you are logged in to the Github account that you used to start the free trial. 

Then, create a new Python file and type the following code:

```python
def is_palindrome(word):
```

Leave the body blank and wait a second or two. Copilot will generate the function body. Of course, this is just a small example. Github Copilot can be an invaluable tool when working with more complex projects.
