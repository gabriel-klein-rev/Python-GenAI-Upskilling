# Upskilling for Python and GenAI

This is a repository full of notes for Python, GenAI, and using Python to explore some GenAI/ML concepts. The formating of the repository is a bit inconsistent, but you should be able to navigate to the topics you want. All of the notes are located in markdown files so you can view from GitHub.

## Python

- Check the notes. All the modules should be located in the modules directory under "Python". For in depth tutorials, I would go through the Python docs tutorials:

    - https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

## GenAI

- Check the notes. All the notes will be listed in individual module directories, with all the files named "cumulative.md". 

## Python with LLMs

- Here are notes for practicing GenAI and ML topics with Python. The notes include python code to help you along.
