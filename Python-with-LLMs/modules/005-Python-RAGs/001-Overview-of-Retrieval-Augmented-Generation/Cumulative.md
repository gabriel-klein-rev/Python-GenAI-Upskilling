Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) is a hybrid approach in natural language processing (NLP) that combines elements of information retrieval and text generation. 

In Large Language Models like GPT, the model is limited to its training data. It is not able to answer prompts that is beyond its knowledge. It was difficult to incorporate data that wouldn't typically be available to public, such as business data, because it meant that the AI practitioners would have to finetune the model with additional data, which can be a costly process. RAG bridges this gap by integrating the retrieval based methods with generative methods, resulting in a more robust and flexible system.

In a typical RAG framework, there are two key components: the retrieval model and the generation model. The retrieval model is responsible for selecting relevant information from a pre-existing knowledge base or corpus, typically in the form of documents or passages. This retrieved information serves as a foundation for the subsequent generation step. The generation model, on the other hand, takes the retrieved content and crafts contextually relevant responses or completions.

The strengths of RAG stem from its adept utilization of both retrieval and generation models. Retrieval ensures access to accurate and relevant information, while generation enables adaptive and contextually appropriate responses. This proves especially effective in tasks like question answering, summarization, and content generation, where striking a balance between leveraging existing knowledge and generating novel content is paramount.

However, the implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces its own set of challenges. The seamless integration of retrieval and generation models presents difficulties, and acquiring high-quality datasets for the retrieval component remains a crucial yet challenging task.
